WATER SUPPLY MANAGEMENT

INTRODUCTION - Indore,like many cities release heavly on river water for itâ€™s supply, with the Narmada River being the primary source.Before this and for the next few years, Indore will not face water shortage now . If we think about the future, now Indore is known as Smart City. But if we talk about water problem in Indore, water is used in abundance and because there is no Waterbill system, the person who consumes more water and the person who consumes less water pay the same amount. Due to this, people do not understand the need for water. In the same way, where water is needed, not enough water is available. So we created hydra pulse as a solution to all these things.
So we will install water meters in every house of Indore so that whoever uses as much water will pay the same amount of water bill. Due to this, awareness about water was created among the people. (Suppose :- 1 paise bill after using 1 liter of water) We are going to take such measures. After that we will install water sensor in advance. And the information about the app that we are going to connect this sensor to the app is given on the next page.


ADVANTAGES :- 1) Water bill will be given only as much as will be used by using water meter.
2) As much water is used, the water bill will have to be paid.
3) If all people understand the need for water, water will not be wasted.

CONCLUSION :- Effective water supply management is essential for municipal corporations to ensure the reliable and equitable distribution of water to urban populations. Implementing a Water Supply Management System (WSMS) allows for real-time monitoring, accurate demand forecasting, and proactive infrastructure management. By leveraging advanced technologies and data analytics, municipal corporations can improve operational efficiency, enhance customer service, and promote sustainable water use. Ultimately, a well-managed water supply system supports public health, economic development, and environmental sustainability, contributing to the overall quality of life for residents.
