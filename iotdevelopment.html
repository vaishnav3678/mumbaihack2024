                <h2>IOT Development in Water supply</h2>
                <p>The provided diagram illustrates an advanced water supply management system utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology. At the heart of this system is the Water Resources Authority, which oversees the management and distribution of water resources. The system relies on IoT-enabled devices, such as sensors, to continuously monitor various parameters of water quality, usage, and distribution. These sensors transmit real-time data to the IoT Cloud, where it is aggregated and sent to remote servers for processing and analysis.</p>
